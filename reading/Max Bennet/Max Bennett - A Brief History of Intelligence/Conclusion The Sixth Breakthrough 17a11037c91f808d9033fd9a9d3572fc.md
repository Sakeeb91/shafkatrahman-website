# Conclusion: The Sixth Breakthrough

### **Chapter Overview:**

- **Main Focus:** This concluding chapter summarizes the five breakthroughs in the evolution of intelligence and speculates on the potential for a sixth breakthrough: the creation of artificial superintelligence (ASI). Bennett argues that while current AI systems are impressive, they lack the essential ingredients of biological intelligence, particularly inner simulation, and suggests that understanding the evolutionary journey of the human brain can provide valuable insights for developing truly intelligent machines. He also explores the possible implications—both positive and negative—of creating ASI.
- **Objectives:**
    - Recap the five breakthroughs and their significance.
    - Introduce the concept of the sixth breakthrough—ASI.
    - Discuss the potential benefits and risks of ASI.
    - Highlight the ethical considerations surrounding the development of ASI.
    - Emphasize the importance of understanding biological intelligence for creating beneficial AI.
- **Fit into Book's Structure:** This chapter provides a concluding synthesis of the book's main arguments and looks toward the future of intelligence, both biological and artificial. It connects the evolutionary history of the human brain to the potential future of AI, emphasizing the continuity and interconnectedness of intelligence across different substrates.

### **Key Terms and Concepts:**

- **Sixth Breakthrough:** The hypothetical creation of artificial superintelligence (ASI). Relevance: This represents the next potential leap in the evolution of intelligence, beyond the biological constraints of the human brain.
- **Artificial Superintelligence (ASI):** An AI system with cognitive abilities far surpassing those of humans. Relevance: ASI is presented as a potential game-changer, with the potential to solve complex problems and transform society in profound ways.
- **Inner Simulation:** An internal model of the world used for prediction, planning, and understanding. Relevance: Bennett emphasizes that inner simulation is a crucial component of biological intelligence, currently lacking in most AI systems.
- **World Model:** An AI's internal representation of the external world. Relevance: Developing robust world models is presented as a key challenge in AI research.
- **Alignment Problem:** The challenge of ensuring that AI goals are aligned with human values. Relevance: This is a major ethical concern in the development of ASI.
- **Existential Risk:** A risk that poses a threat to the survival of humanity. Relevance: ASI is discussed as a potential existential risk, given its potentially vast capabilities.

### **Central Thesis and Supporting Arguments:**

- **Central Thesis:** The next major leap in the evolution of intelligence may be the creation of artificial superintelligence, which, if its values can be aligned with human values, holds tremendous potential for solving complex problems but also poses significant risks if we do not approach its development thoughtfully and ethically, by learning from the evolutionary history of the human mind.
- **Supporting Arguments:**
    - **Limitations of current AI:** Most current AI systems, including LLMs, lack inner simulation and common sense, highlighting the gap between artificial and biological intelligence.
    - **Potential of ASI:** ASI could potentially solve complex problems, accelerate scientific discovery, and transform society in positive ways.
    - **Risks of ASI:** ASI also poses existential risks, including the potential for misaligned goals, unintended consequences, and the loss of human control.
    - **Importance of understanding biological intelligence**: Studying the evolution of the human brain can provide valuable insights for developing beneficial and safe AI.
    - **The need for ethical considerations:** The development of ASI raises profound ethical questions that must be carefully considered.

### **Observations and Insights:**

- **Evolutionary perspective on AI**: Bennett places AI within the broader context of the evolution of intelligence, arguing that it represents a potential continuation of this long-term trend.
- **Intelligence as problem-solving:** The author reiterates his core principle that “intelligence” is a measure of computational problem-solving capacity regardless of what the “problem’ is or what substrate that intelligence is implemented within. This suggests that “intelligence” itself is not uniquely human but can emerge from non-biological systems as well, given the correct circumstances. (Bennett, 2023, p. 367).
- **The role of values in shaping the future of intelligence**: The author highlights the inherent human tendency to try to create things ‘in our image’ and mentions the greek myth of Prometheus who created human beings from clay (Bennett, 2023, p. 397). This implies that, whether we intend to do so or not, there is a greater likelihood that our earliest ASI systems may exhibit a similar underlying cognitive architecture to the architecture of the brains and minds they were created by. And for this reason, he argues, it may be useful to understand better the origin and development of traits we value, such as curiosity and kindness, as well as the origin and development of less desirable traits such as violence and deception, since past choices may very well propagate themselves into the future as the evolutionary development of intelligence transitions from carbon to silicon (Bennett, 2023, p. 397).

### **Unique Interpretations and Unconventional Ideas:**

- **Emphasis on inner simulation as crucial for ASI**: This contrasts with some views in AI that focus primarily on computational power and algorithms.

### **Problems and Solutions:**

| Problem/Challenge | Proposed Solution/Approach | Page/Section Reference |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Current AI lacks inner simulation and common sense | Study the evolution of biological intelligence, develop more sophisticated world models | Throughout chapter |
| Alignment problem (misaligned AI goals) | Careful consideration of AI values and ethics, aligning AI goals with human values | 363-364 |
| Existential risks of ASI | Developing safeguards and control mechanisms, international cooperation | Implicit |

### **Categorical Items:**

The author categorizes the five major breakthroughs from the book, using this to provide a summary of the key ideas (Bennett, 2023, p. 364-365).

### **Literature and References:**

No specific works are cited in the conclusion, but the author implicitly draws on the broader literature in AI, neuroscience, and philosophy discussed throughout the book.

### **Areas for Further Research:**

- Developing robust and generalizable world models for AI.
- Understanding the neural basis of consciousness and subjective experience.
- Exploring the ethical and societal implications of ASI.

### **Critical Analysis:**

- **Strengths:** The conclusion effectively synthesizes the book's main arguments and raises important questions about the future of intelligence. The emphasis on the importance of biological intelligence for AI research is a valuable perspective.
- **Weaknesses:** The discussion of ASI is necessarily speculative, and the chapter could benefit from more concrete examples of potential solutions to the alignment problem and other existential risks.

### **Practical Applications:**

- The chapter's emphasis on ethical considerations can inform policy discussions and guide the responsible development of AI.

### **Connections to Other Chapters:**

- Chapters 1-22: The conclusion synthesizes and integrates the key ideas from all previous chapters, highlighting the evolutionary trajectory of intelligence and its potential future in AI.
- No future chapters are foreshadowed since this is the concluding chapter.

### **Surprising, Interesting, and Novel Ideas:**

- **The sixth breakthrough as the creation of ASI:** This idea positions AI development within the broader context of the evolution of intelligence, suggesting a potential future beyond the limitations of biological brains (Bennett, 2023, p. 363).
- **The emphasis on inner simulation as crucial for ASI:** This perspective challenges traditional AI approaches that focus primarily on computational power and algorithms (Bennett, 2023, p. 363-364).
- **The link between past choices and future outcomes:** The concept that even past evolutionary “bottlenecks” such as extinctions and random asteroid impacts, as well as intentional human choices regarding which traits to select for in ourselves and what to design and build in our tools, create “path dependencies” that constrain the possibility space of future evolutionary development (Bennett, 2023, p. 369). This suggests a form of biological and even intellectual ‘determinism’ since if we want to ‘steer’ the trajectory of our own species toward better outcomes in the future, we must ‘look backward’ and more closely understand the choices of our past (Bennett, 2023, p. 369). And the author emphasizes that understanding the processes of human brain evolution and their relation to cultural evolution, including the evolutionary mechanisms of meme propagation and how language emerged as a method to share and preserve these memes, which created a shared human culture in the form of a hive-mind, may be a crucial step in ensuring that when we develop increasingly sophisticated AI systems we do not unintentionally imbue those systems with the values and desires of some previous generation or culture which may no longer be so desirable (Bennett, 2023, p. 397). And so, studying the ‘evolutionary bottlenecks’ of biology, Bennett suggests, may offer us clues into how and what we should create and steer towards in our artificial creations.

### **Discussion Questions:**

- What are the most promising approaches to developing ASI, and what are the key challenges that need to be overcome?
- How can we ensure that ASI is aligned with human values and goals?
- What are the potential benefits and risks of creating ASI, and how can we mitigate those risks?
- How might the development of ASI impact society, culture, and the future of humanity?
- If intelligence is not limited to biological brains, what other forms of intelligence might exist or emerge in the future?

### **Visual Representation:**

[Five Breakthroughs of Biological Intelligence] --> [Sixth Breakthrough (ASI)] --> [Potential Benefits & Risks]

### TLDR:

<aside>
📌

Human intelligence, built on five breakthroughs—*steering* (Ch. 2), *reinforcing* (Ch. 2 & 6), *simulating* (Ch. 3, 11, & 12), *mentalizing* (Ch. 4, 15, & 16), and *speaking* (Ch. 5, 19, & 20)—might not be the final chapter. The sixth breakthrough could be artificial superintelligence (ASI) (Bennett, 2023, p. 363). While current AI, like LLMs (Ch. 22), excels at narrow tasks, they lack the *inner simulation* (Ch. 3 & 11) and common sense that makes human intelligence so powerful.  Building robust "world models" in AI, echoing the brain's internal models (Ch. 9), is key (Bennett, 2023, p. 363-364). ASI has huge potential, but also existential risks; the "alignment problem"—ensuring AI's goals match ours is crucial (Bennett, 2023, p. 363-364).  Key ideas: ASI as the potential next step, the limitations of current AI, the importance of world models, and the alignment problem. Core philosophy:  Understanding how *we* got smart is crucial for building AI that's not just powerful, but beneficial.  Just as evolution tinkered with existing parts from past eras (Ch. 1, 5, & 10) to develop new skills, we must consider *our* values and biases when creating ASI, lest we recreate our own flaws in silicon. This conclusion emphasizes the long view of intelligence, from the first cells to potential future minds, and the profound responsibility we have in shaping what comes next, highlighting that the evolution of intelligence is itself an ongoing and unpredictable experiment (Bennett, 2023, p. 367).
