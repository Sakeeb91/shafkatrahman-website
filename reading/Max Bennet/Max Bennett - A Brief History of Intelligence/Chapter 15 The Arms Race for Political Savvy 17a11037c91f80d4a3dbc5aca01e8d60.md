# Chapter 15: The Arms Race for Political Savvy

### **Chapter Overview:**

- **Main Focus:** This chapter explores the social intelligence of primates, arguing that the demands of navigating complex social hierarchies drove the evolution of larger brains and more sophisticated cognitive abilities, particularly theory of mind. Bennett suggests that early primates, unlike other mammals, developed large brains to ‘politick’ their way to the top, rather than fight their way to the top (Bennett, 2023, p. 285).
- **Objectives:**
    - Describe the unique social structures of primates.
    - Explain the social brain hypothesis and its supporting evidence.
    - Introduce the concept of Machiavellian intelligence.
    - Highlight the role of theory of mind in primate social dynamics.
    - Connect the evolution of primate sociality to the later development of language and human cooperation.
- **Fit into Book's Structure:** This chapter details the fourth major breakthrough in Bennett’s framework: *mentalizing*, understanding the minds of others (Bennett, 2023, p. 274). It bridges the gap between the individual intelligence of mammals, discussed in previous chapters, and the highly social intelligence of primates, which sets the stage for the emergence of language and human uniqueness.

### **Key Terms and Concepts:**

- **Social Brain Hypothesis:** The hypothesis that the demands of social life drove the evolution of larger brains in primates. Relevance: This hypothesis provides the evolutionary framework for the chapter.
- **Machiavellian Intelligence:** A form of intelligence that involves social manipulation, deception, and political maneuvering. Relevance: This concept is used to describe the complex social strategies employed by primates.
- **Theory of Mind:** The ability to understand and attribute mental states (beliefs, intentions, desires) to oneself and others. Relevance: Theory of mind is presented as a crucial cognitive ability for navigating complex social interactions.
- **Grooming:** A social behavior in primates that involves cleaning and maintaining the fur of others. Relevance: Grooming is discussed as a form of social bonding and alliance formation, demonstrating that social relationships between primates are not merely about close family ties or proximity but can be formed with non-family members and with individuals of different social rankings (Bennett, 2023, p. 247).
- **Dominance Hierarchy:** A social ranking system where individuals compete for resources and status. Relevance: Primate societies are structured by dominance hierarchies, and theory of mind is crucial for navigating these hierarchies.
- **Reciprocal Altruism:** Acts of kindness or cooperation performed with the expectation of future reciprocation. Relevance: Reciprocal altruism is presented as a key factor in primate sociality and, the author argues, is one of the main reasons that the cognitive breakthrough of theory of mind emerged in early primates.
- **Kin Selection:** Altruistic behavior directed towards relatives. Relevance: Kin selection is discussed as a factor in primate sociality, but Bennett argues that it can't fully explain the complex alliances and social dynamics observed in primate groups.
- **Social Savviness:** The ability to effectively navigate complex social situations. Relevance: Bennett notes that social savviness in primates correlates with larger brain size and the size of the neocortex, even after accounting for the expected brain scaling from larger body size. This suggests that larger brains themselves were not selected for randomly but for some advantage they offered in navigating social situations (Bennett, 2023, p. 285), and this may have been a unique pressure on early primates.

### **Key Figures:**

- **Robin Dunbar:** Proposed the social brain hypothesis. Relevance: Dunbar's work provides the foundational theory for the chapter.
- **Nicholas Humphrey:** A psychologist who studied primate intelligence and social behavior. Relevance: Humphrey's work on Machiavellian intelligence is discussed in the context of primate social strategies.
- **Frans de Waal:** A primatologist known for his research on primate social behavior and empathy. Relevance: De Waal's work provides further support for the social brain hypothesis, highlighting how primates evolved to consider the social consequences of their actions far more than other vertebrates.
- **Emil Menzel:** A primatologist who studied mental maps and deception in chimpanzees. Relevance: Menzel's research provides evidence for theory of mind in chimpanzees, by highlighting how chimpanzees in his study, such as Belle and Rock, changed their strategies depending on the observed behavior of others in their social group (Bennett, 2023, p. 244-245).

### **Central Thesis and Supporting Arguments:**

- **Central Thesis:** The complex social lives of primates, characterized by dominance hierarchies, alliances, and Machiavellian intelligence, drove the evolution of larger brains and more sophisticated cognitive abilities, including theory of mind.
- **Supporting Arguments:**
    - **Correlation between brain size and social group size:** Larger primate social groups are associated with larger neocortices.
    - **Evidence of Machiavellian intelligence:** Primates engage in deception, manipulation, and political maneuvering, suggesting an understanding of others' mental states.
    - **Importance of social relationships:** Grooming, alliance formation, and other social behaviors demonstrate the significance of social bonds in primate societies.
    - **Adaptive advantages of theory of mind:** Understanding others' intentions, beliefs, and knowledge is crucial for navigating complex social hierarchies and maximizing reproductive success.

### **Observations and Insights:**

- **Primate social structures are complex and dynamic:** They involve fluid alliances, shifting power dynamics, and intricate social networks.
- **Social intelligence is not just about cooperation:** It also involves competition, deception, and the ability to manipulate others.
- **The role of "free time" in primate social evolution:** Bennett suggests that the abundance of food (fruit) available to early primates freed up time and energy for social interaction and the development of political savvy (Bennett, 2023, p. 251-252). This argument is interesting but speculative.

### **Unique Interpretations and Unconventional Ideas:**

- **Emphasis on the "arms race" for social intelligence:** This frames primate social evolution as a competitive struggle, where individuals with better social skills are more likely to survive and reproduce.
- **Connection between social intelligence and later breakthroughs like language:** Bennett suggests that the complex social lives of primates laid the groundwork for the emergence of human language, as language relies on similar theory-of-mind mechanisms.

### **Problems and Solutions:**

| Problem/Challenge | Proposed Solution/Approach | Page/Section Reference |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Competition for resources and mates | Dominance hierarchies, alliances, Machiavellian intelligence | Throughout chapter |
| Navigating complex social hierarchies | Theory of mind | 246-247, 255 |
| Maintaining social cohesion | Grooming, reciprocal altruism | 247-250 |

### **Categorical Items:**

Bennett categorizes different primate social structures (solitary, pair-bonded, harems, multi-male groups) and relates these structures to the cognitive demands of social life. He also categorizes different dominance signals in primates, such as the approach-retreat routine (Bennett, 2023, p. 247-248).

### **Literature and References:**

- Works by Dunbar, Humphrey, de Waal, Menzel, and others are cited.
- Studies on primate behavior, brain size, social networks, and theory of mind are referenced.

### **Areas for Further Research:**

- The neural basis of Machiavellian intelligence and its relationship to theory of mind needs further investigation.
- The precise evolutionary pathways that led to the development of complex primate social structures are not fully understood.
- The role of culture and learning in shaping primate social behavior requires further exploration.

### **Critical Analysis:**

- **Strengths:** This chapter offers a compelling and insightful account of primate social intelligence, integrating evolutionary, behavioral, and cognitive perspectives. The discussions of Machiavellian intelligence and theory of mind are particularly engaging.
- **Weaknesses:** The chapter's emphasis on competition and social manipulation may underemphasize the role of cooperation and altruism in primate societies. The “free time” hypothesis lacks strong supporting evidence.

### **Practical Applications:**

- Understanding primate social dynamics can inform our understanding of human social behavior, leadership, and conflict resolution. It can also provide insights into the design and implementation of policies which are intended to address inequities related to social status and family hierarchies, though this is likely not the intention of the author.

### **Connections to Other Chapters:**

- Chapters 11, 12, and 13 (Neocortex, Simulating, and Model-Based Learning): This chapter builds upon those chapters by showing how the neocortex's simulation abilities are crucial for *mentalizing*. The author describes mentalizing as simulating what other people might be thinking or doing, highlighting how a more recent expansion in areas of the prefrontal cortex were linked to improved theory-of-mind abilities, suggesting that these neural structures evolved, in part, to create models of other people’s minds, not just models of the world (Bennett, 2023, p. 259).
- Chapter 10 (Neural Dark Ages): This chapter illustrates the unique evolutionary pressures that early mammals, and later primates, experienced, highlighting how primates were unusually social because they evolved to spend far more of their waking hours in activities that were directly related to social dynamics, such as politicking and grooming and forming coalitions (Bennett, 2023, p. 251). Bennett then uses this argument to justify why primates, unlike other mammals such as the tiger or bear or mouse or wolf, may have uniquely evolved theory-of-mind abilities, since primate social groups became organized by something beyond strength and physical attributes, which is political savvy. This then sets up the following chapter’s discussion of theory of mind in more detail.
- Chapter 16 (How to Model Other Minds): This chapter sets the stage for the following chapter's in-depth exploration of theory of mind and its neural basis.
- Chapter 17 (Monkey Hammers & Self-Driving Cars): This chapter foreshadows the discussion of tool use and imitation learning in primates, by arguing that it was the capacity for theory of mind, and understanding others’ *intentions*, which allowed primates to more effectively learn and pass down tool use across generations. In other words, tool use is a product of *social learning* and is thereby indirectly tied to mentalizing. In contrast, most animals with tool-using capacity such as the sea otter or the mongoose use tools in exactly the same way despite never encountering other members of their same species (Bennett, 2023, p. 275-277).
- Chapter 18 (Why Rats Can’t Go Grocery Shopping): This chapter foreshadows how social intelligence and planning enabled primates to perform complex cognitive feats like anticipating future needs. This explains why rats or other mammals struggle to anticipate future needs, but monkeys do not (Bennett, 2023, p. 285-287). He uses an example of squirrel monkeys being able to forgo treats in the present moment in anticipation of not having access to water later, and ties this to a primate’s capacity for thinking strategically about the future.
- Chapter 19 (The Search for Human Uniqueness): This chapter establishes theory of mind as the cognitive breakthrough which paved the way for language evolution in humans and our ability to have and communicate abstract thoughts with each other (Bennett, 2023, p. 296). He emphasizes that theory of mind and language may be two sides of the same coin—mentalizing may be a prerequisite for understanding how to use language with other people’s minds. He supports this argument by highlighting the correlation between language abilities and theory-of-mind abilities in childhood development and in human brain structure (Bennett, 2023, p. 260, 262).

### **Surprising, Interesting, and Novel Ideas:**

- **The "arms race" for political savvy:** Bennett's framing of primate social evolution as a competitive struggle for status and resources offers a fresh perspective on the development of social intelligence (Bennett, 2023, p. 237-239, 252).
- **The importance of social alliances in primate societies:** The intricate web of alliances and rivalries in primate groups highlights the complexity of their social lives and suggests that theory-of-mind capabilities may have evolved not just from trying to understand the mental states of any random individual of a species but in trying to understand and interpret how these social networks are structured, which individuals tend to support each other during conflicts and which do not, and thereby predict how individuals in such social structures are most likely to behave in future interactions (Bennett, 2023, p. 285).
- **The link between "free time" and the evolution of social intelligence:** Bennett's suggestion that the abundance of readily available food (fruit) in early primate environments may have freed up time for social interaction and the development of political skills is an intriguing, albeit speculative, idea (Bennett, 2023, p. 285).

### **Discussion Questions:**

- How does the social brain hypothesis explain the large brain size of primates compared to other mammals?
- What are the ethical implications of viewing primate social behavior through the lens of Machiavellian intelligence?
- How does theory of mind contribute to successful navigation of social hierarchies?
- What are the similarities and differences between human social intelligence and that of other primates?
- How might the insights from this chapter be applied to improve human social interactions and conflict resolution?

### TL;DR:

<aside>
📌

Primates didn't just get bigger brains; they got *social* brains.  The complex social lives of early primates, with their dominance hierarchies and shifting alliances, fueled an "arms race" for social intelligence (Bennett, 2023, p. 252).  Unlike other mammals relying on brute strength or simple *reinforcement learning* (Ch. 2 & 6), primates evolved *theory of mind*—the ability to *simulate* (Ch. 3, 11, & 12) the mental states of others (foreshadowing Ch. 16) (Bennett, 2023, p. 246-247).  This "Machiavellian intelligence" enabled them to navigate social complexities, form strategic alliances (like grooming partnerships, which go beyond simple kin selection), deceive rivals, and predict the behavior of others, all improving chances of securing better positions in the group’s social hierarchy (Bennett, 2023, p. 247-250).  This social pressure for bigger, better brains explains the correlation between neocortex size and social group size in primates (Bennett, 2023, p. 254), which itself is tied to the amount of ‘free time’ a primate species has (Bennett, 2023, p. 285). Key ideas: the social brain hypothesis, Machiavellian intelligence, theory of mind, and the importance of social connections. Core philosophy:  Intelligence isn't just about understanding the physical world; it's also about understanding the social world—a crucial step toward the collaborative, knowledge-sharing societies of humans (Ch. 19) and the uniquely human capacity for language. This chapter links the neocortex's simulation abilities (Ch. 11 & 12) to the specific demands of primate social life, setting the stage for the discussion of how primates actually “model other minds” (Ch. 16) and learn through imitation (Ch. 17 & 18), which are key components of primate intelligence.
