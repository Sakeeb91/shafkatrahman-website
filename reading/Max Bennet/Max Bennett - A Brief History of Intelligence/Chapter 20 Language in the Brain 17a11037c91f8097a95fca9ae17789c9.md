# Chapter 20: Language in the Brain

### **Chapter Overview:**

- **Main Focus:** This chapter explores the neural underpinnings of language, examining how this uniquely human ability is implemented in the brain. Bennett challenges the traditional focus on specific language areas like Broca's and Wernicke's areas, arguing that language is a more distributed and complex phenomenon that emerges from the interplay of multiple brain regions and pre-existing cognitive mechanisms.
- **Objectives:**
    - Describe the traditional view of language areas in the brain and its limitations.
    - Explore the relationship between language and other cognitive abilities, such as motor control, *simulation* (Ch. 3), and theory of mind (Ch. 17).
    - Discuss the role of the neocortex and other brain regions in language processing.
    - Highlight the importance of learning and cultural transmission in language acquisition.
    - Connect the neural basis of language to the broader theme of the human "hive mind."
- **Fit into Book's Structure:** This chapter provides a deeper dive into the neural mechanisms underlying Breakthrough #5, *speaking*. It builds upon the previous chapter's discussion of the unique properties of human language, explaining *how* this complex system is implemented in the brain. It sets the stage for the final discussions of the co-evolution of language and the human mind, as well as the potential and limitations of artificial intelligence.

### **Key Terms and Concepts:**

- **Broca's Area:** A region in the frontal lobe traditionally associated with language production. Relevance: Damage to Broca's area results in Broca's aphasia, characterized by difficulty producing speech, but not in understanding it. Bennett uses examples of patients with damage to Broca’s area to demonstrate that this same brain region is required for *producing* language regardless of the ‘medium’ by which that language is produced (e.g., verbal or sign language) (Bennett, 2023, p. 311-312, 316). This suggests that Broca’s area is involved in something fundamental about generating language, not just controlling the vocal cords (Bennett, 2023, p. 317). He also emphasizes the importance of language and these brain regions in the ability of humans to *transfer* complex sequences of intended future actions (or plans), as well as entire “inner simulations” to others—the unique feature of human language that may explain the unusual altruism and cooperation present in human interactions, which Bennett refers to as the “hive mind” (Bennett, 2023, p. 337).
- **Wernicke's Area:** A region in the temporal lobe associated with language comprehension. Relevance: Damage to Wernicke's area causes Wernicke's aphasia, characterized by fluent but nonsensical speech and difficulty understanding language.
- **Aphasia:** A language disorder caused by brain damage. Relevance: Different types of aphasia (Broca's, Wernicke's) provide insights into the functions of different language areas.
- **Neocortex:** The outer layer of the cerebral cortex, involved in higher-level cognitive functions. Relevance: The neocortex plays a crucial role in language processing, particularly in the integration of language with other cognitive abilities like theory of mind (Ch. 16) (Bennett, 2023, p. 317). This is supported by the fact that the language areas of the neocortex, including Broca’s and Wernicke’s areas, are similar across primates, not just humans (Bennett, 2023, p. 313). However, Bennett emphasizes that damage to these same areas in non-human primates does *not* impair their ability to communicate with each other, whereas damage to these areas in humans causes significant impairments in language use (Bennett, 2023, p. 314). This suggests that there may be subtle but important differences between human neocortex and non-human primate neocortex when it comes to language processing.
- **Motor Cortex:** A region of the frontal lobe involved in controlling voluntary movements. Relevance: The motor cortex is discussed in relation to the production of speech and sign language.
- **Basal Ganglia:** Subcortical structures involved in motor control, learning, and habit formation. Relevance: The basal ganglia are implicated in the automatization of language production, allowing for fluent speech and writing.
- **Proto-conversations:** Pre-linguistic interactions between infants and caregivers, involving turn-taking, vocalizations, and gestures. Relevance: Bennett argues that proto-conversations are a crucial precursor to language development, setting the stage for the learning of declarative labels and grammar.
- **Joint Attention:** The shared focus of two individuals on an object or event. Relevance: Joint attention is considered a prerequisite for teaching and learning declarative labels, and is associated with larger vocabulary size in young children. Bennett suggests that such joint-attention mechanisms may be uniquely human, or at least uniquely emphasized in human infants, and is one of the reasons that humans are so capable of learning and using language (Bennett, 2023, p. 319).
- **Language Curriculum:** The set of innate predispositions and social interactions that guide language acquisition in infants. Relevance: This concept emphasizes the importance of both biology and environment in language development. He points out that language has a *learning curriculum* not unlike that of how birds learn to fly (Bennett, 2023, p. 317). This is seen in how infants engage in proto-conversations, joint attention with parents, over-imitate teachers, and ask questions with the universal rising intonation of query (Bennett, 2023, p. 320-321). It is this learning curriculum which repurposes earlier areas of the neocortex, particularly the metalizing circuits of primates discussed earlier (Ch. 16), into those used for processing and generating language, which explains why children with parts of their brains removed can still learn to speak fluently (Bennett, 2023, p. 322). This learning process is also highly dependent on the child having lots of exposure and interaction with others from whom to learn, which the author uses to explain why children deprived of interaction develop ‘feral’ tendencies and struggle to acquire language later in life (Bennett, 2023, p. 320).

### **Key Figures:**

- **Paul Broca:** A physician who identified Broca's area. Relevance: Broca's work provided early evidence for the localization of language functions in the brain.
- **Carl Wernicke:** A neurologist who discovered Wernicke's area. Relevance: Wernicke's research furthered our understanding of the neural basis of language comprehension.
- **Neil Smith and Ianthi-Maria Tsimpli:** Researchers who studied Christopher, a language savant. Relevance: Christopher’s case illustrates the modularity of language in the brain and how language abilities can be dissociated from other cognitive skills (Bennett, 2023, p. 313).
- **Jane Goodall:** A primatologist known for her research on chimpanzees. Relevance: Goodall's observation that chimpanzees struggle to make sounds in the absence of an associated *emotional state* is used to highlight the distinction between human language and the emotional expression systems of other primates. This supports the idea that the hardwired emotional-expression circuitry of the brain is separate from the language circuitry (Bennett, 2023, p. 315). He demonstrates that this same distinction between intentional and emotional communication is present even in humans—humans can voluntarily smile, but humans also involuntarily smile when experiencing an emotional state of happiness. These two systems for controlling facial expressions, though they both use the same muscles, are controlled by different parts of the brain and are related to separate neural circuits and structures, suggesting that human emotional expressions are more like nonhuman primate communication and less like human language (Bennett, 2023, p. 315).
- **Jeffrey Elman:** A cognitive scientist who used neural networks to study language processing and demonstrated how a simple curriculum could significantly improve the ability of a network to learn complex sentence structure (Bennett, 2023, p. 318). Relevance: Elman’s research supports Bennett's argument that language is learned through a curriculum, not unlike how birds learn to fly, which explains why children systematically learn the most basic sentences first and only later develop an understanding of more sophisticated sentence structures and the more subtle and nuanced aspects of grammar.

### **Central Thesis and Supporting Arguments:**

- **Central Thesis:** Language, while relying on some specialized brain regions like Broca's and Wernicke's areas, is a complex and distributed cognitive ability that emerges from the interplay of multiple brain systems and a hardwired learning curriculum (Bennett, 2023, p. 322) rather than just a larger neocortex. This explains why humans are uniquely capable of language, whereas other primates are not.
- **Supporting Arguments:**
    - **The limitations of traditional language areas:** Damage to Broca's and Wernicke's areas impairs language, but doesn’t explain everything. Other brain regions and networks are also involved, as evidenced by the fact that language can be learned and used even with damage to these areas, such as in children with entire brain hemispheres removed.
    - **The role of the neocortex**: The neocortex is involved in integrating language with other cognitive abilities like motor control, theory of mind, *simulation* (Ch. 3, 11, & 12), and planning, enabling humans to engage in higher level thought processes which can be transferred to others via language (Bennett, 2023, p. 317).
    - **The importance of learning**: Language acquisition is a complex process that relies heavily on learning and cultural transmission. The hardwired ‘instinct’ for proto-conversations, joint attention, over-imitation, and asking questions, suggests that language is taught and learned through a curriculum (Bennett, 2023, p. 317-320), and this may be what differentiates human language abilities from those of other primates.
    - **The role of emotions and non-verbal communication**: Human language is intertwined with our emotional expression systems, which are themselves vestiges of earlier primate vocalizations and gestures (Bennett, 2023, p. 314-317). This explains why people with damage to areas for language can still laugh, cry, and express emotions through tone and prosody. Bennett uses the example of someone with stroke-induced facial paralysis to illustrate this (Bennett, 2023, p. 315). And although these emotional systems can be modified and controlled via the neocortex, this neocortical input is, in essence, just a refinement on what already occurs automatically as involuntary responses from earlier pre-neocortical brain structures.

### **Observations and Insights:**

- **The modularity of language:** Language is not a single, monolithic ability, but is composed of multiple interacting components (phonology, syntax, semantics, pragmatics).
- **The distributed nature of language in the brain:** Language processing is not limited to specific "language areas," but involves a network of brain regions working together.

### **Unique Interpretations and Unconventional Ideas:**

- **Language as a repurposing of existing cognitive mechanisms:** Bennett argues that language emerged not from the evolution of entirely new brain structures, but from the repurposing of existing mechanisms like those involved in theory of mind and motor control, highlighting how the ‘curriculum’ for learning language may have simply tweaked existing neural pathways to build an entirely new structure (Bennett, 2023, p. 322), explaining both how children learn language so effectively and why language is found in all humans but no other primates.

### **Problems and Solutions:**

| Problem/Challenge | Proposed Solution/Approach | Page/Section Reference |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Communicating complex thoughts and simulations | Declarative labels, grammar | 297-300 |
| Acquiring language | Language curriculum, proto-conversations, joint attention | 317-321 |
| Automating language production | Basal ganglia, motor cortex | 312-313 |

### **Categorical Items:**

Bennett distinguishes between different types of language (verbal, sign) and aphasia (Broca's, Wernicke's) to demonstrate the modularity and distributed nature of language in the brain (Bennett, 2023, p. 311).  He also uses categories to show differences and similarities in communication systems across species (simple vocalizations vs. true language), highlighting the unique properties of human language.

### **Literature and References:**

- Works by Broca, Wernicke, Smith, Tsimpli, Goodall, Elman, and others are cited.
- Research on aphasia, language acquisition, animal communication, and the neural basis of language is referenced.

### **Areas for Further Research:**

- The precise neural interactions and computations that give rise to language are still being uncovered.
- The role of different brain regions in various aspects of language processing (syntax, semantics, pragmatics) requires further exploration.
- The interplay between language, thought, and consciousness is a complex and fascinating area for future research.

### **Critical Analysis:**

- **Strengths:** The chapter challenges simplistic notions of language localization in the brain and provides a more nuanced and complex view of language processing. The emphasis on learning and cultural transmission is a valuable contribution.
- **Weaknesses:** The chapter could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the different theories of language evolution. The precise neural mechanisms underlying the proposed "language curriculum" require further investigation.

### **Practical Applications:**

- Understanding the neural basis of language can inform the development of more effective language teaching methods, therapies for language disorders, and brain-computer interfaces for communication. Bennett emphasizes that the “language curriculum” of humans explains why they are able to acquire the skill so rapidly without formal training or instruction (Bennett, 2023, p. 322). He highlights how children can learn by being exposed to language without being explicitly taught vocabulary or grammar (Bennett, 2023, p. 312). He contrasts this with language-learning in apes who do not exhibit the same innate predispositions to learn and use grammar and require painstaking training from human teachers to do so (Bennett, 2023, p. 322).

### **Connections to Other Chapters:**

- Chapter 19 (Search for Human Uniqueness): This chapter builds upon the previous chapter's argument for the uniqueness of human language by exploring its neural basis. It explains *how* human language can create a “hive-mind” and promote cooperation across large groups.
- Chapters 14, 16, 17, and 18 (Primates, Tool Use, Theory of Mind and Planning for the Future): This chapter connects language to other cognitive abilities, particularly *motor control* (Ch. 14), theory of mind, and the capacity for mental time travel and future planning. This reinforces Bennett's view of language as an emergent property of existing cognitive mechanisms and circuits. He links these connections together by mentioning studies of children and primates which show a correlation between language skills and theory of mind abilities, whereby damage to areas that impair one tends to impair the other (Bennett, 2023, p. 353-354), further supporting the author’s argument that humans are able to correctly ‘infer’ another mind’s intended meaning, even if this meaning isn’t explicitly stated in the language itself, because they are using these mentalizing regions for language processing.
- Chapter 22 (ChatGPT): This chapter foreshadows the discussion of large language models by highlighting the complexity of human language and the challenges of replicating it in artificial systems.

### **Surprising, Interesting, and Novel Ideas:**

- **The language curriculum**: The idea that humans have a hardwired "curriculum" for learning language, similar to how birds have a curriculum for learning to fly, challenges traditional views of language acquisition (Bennett, 2023, p. 317-322).
- **The link between emotional expressions and language**: The chapter suggests that our capacity for language may have evolved from our emotional expression system, with language repurposing some of the same neural circuits and mechanisms (Bennett, 2023, p. 314-317).
- **The distributed nature of language in the brain:** This challenges the simplistic view of language being localized to just Broca's and Wernicke's areas, highlighting the involvement of multiple brain regions (Bennett, 2023, p. 317).

### **Discussion Questions:**

- How might the concept of a "language curriculum" inform language teaching and learning?
- What are the evolutionary advantages of linking language to our emotional expression system?
- How does the distributed nature of language in the brain make it more robust and adaptable?
- What are the implications of the similarities and differences between human language and ape language for our understanding of the evolution of language?
- How can understanding the neural basis of language inform the development of more effective treatments for language disorders?

## TL;DR:

<aside>
📌

Language isn't just about Broca's and Wernicke's areas; it's a whole-brain *simulation* (Ch. 3, 11, & 12) symphony.  While these areas are important, language is a complex system built on earlier breakthroughs—*motor control* (Ch. 14), *mentalizing* (Ch. 4 & 16), and emotional expressions, which themselves are remnants of primate vocalizations (Bennett, 2023, p. 312-317).  Humans, unlike other primates, have a "language curriculum"—hardwired instincts for proto-conversations, joint attention, and over-imitating, which allows us to effortlessly absorb language's building blocks: *declarative labels* and *grammar* (Bennett, 2023, p. 318-322).  This sets us up for the "hive mind"—sharing complex thoughts and building knowledge across generations (Ch. 19) (Bennett, 2023, p. 314). Key ideas: language as a distributed brain system, the language curriculum, and the link between emotions and language.  Core philosophy: Language is a uniquely human adaptation built from pre-existing parts and repurposed existing neural circuits, a testament to evolution's tinkering and preparing for its limits in AI language models.
