# Chapter 11: Generative Models and the Neocortical Mystery

### **Chapter Overview:**

- **Main Focus:** This chapter delves into the structure and function of the neocortex, proposing that it operates as a generative model, simulating the world to predict and interpret sensory input. Bennett draws parallels between the neocortex and artificial generative models, highlighting both the similarities and key differences.
- **Objectives:**
    - Explain the concept of a generative model and how it relates to perception.
    - Describe the structure and function of the neocortex, including its layered architecture and columnar organization.
    - Discuss the evidence supporting the generative model hypothesis of the neocortex.
    - Explore the phenomena of illusions, hallucinations, dreams, and imagination in the context of generative models.
    - Compare and contrast biological and artificial generative models.
- **Fit into Book's Structure:** This chapter represents the culmination of Breakthrough #3, *simulating*. It explains *how* the neocortex enables the simulation of entire worlds in the minds of mammals, building upon the foundations laid by earlier chapters on pattern recognition, temporal difference learning, and the evolution of the cortex. It sets the stage for subsequent discussions of planning, mentalizing, and language.

### **Key Terms and Concepts:**

- **Generative Model:** A probabilistic model that learns to generate data similar to the data it was trained on. In the context of the brain, a generative model creates simulations of the world to predict and interpret sensory input (Bennett, 2023, p. 178). Relevance: This is the central concept of the chapter, offering a powerful framework for understanding neocortical function.
- **Neocortex:** The outermost layer of the cerebral cortex, responsible for higher-level cognitive functions. Relevance: The neocortex is hypothesized to be the primary locus of the brain's generative model.
- **Neocortical Column:** A vertical column of neurons in the neocortex, thought to be a fundamental computational unit. Relevance: Mountcastle's theory suggests that these columns may represent the basic algorithms used to generate the simulation in the neocortex (Bennett, 2023, p. 168-169).
- **Perception as Inference:** The idea that perception is not a passive process of absorbing sensory information, but an active process of inferring the most likely cause of that information (Bennett, 2023, p. 176). Relevance: Generative models provide a mechanism for implementing perception as inference.
- **Illusions:** Perceptual experiences that do not match the objective reality. Relevance: Illusions are presented as evidence for the brain's use of a generative model, where the model's predictions sometimes mismatch the actual sensory input.
- **Hallucinations:** Perceptual experiences that occur in the absence of any external sensory input. Relevance: Hallucinations are explained as unconstrained simulations generated by the neocortex when sensory input is disrupted.
- **Dreams:** Mental experiences during sleep. Relevance: Dreams are interpreted as a form of unconstrained simulation, allowing the brain's generative model to explore possibilities and consolidate memories.
- **Imagination:** The ability to form mental images and concepts of things not present to the senses. Relevance: Imagination is presented as the generative model operating in the absence of sensory constraints.
- **Supervised Learning:** A type of machine learning where the algorithm is trained on labeled data. Relevance: This is contrasted with unsupervised learning, which is thought to be more similar to how the brain learns.
- **Unsupervised Learning:** A type of machine learning where the algorithm identifies patterns in unlabeled data. Relevance: Generative models can be trained using unsupervised learning, making them more biologically plausible than supervised learning models.
- **Backpropagation:** An algorithm for training artificial neural networks. Relevance: Backpropagation is effective but biologically implausible, highlighting a key difference between artificial and biological neural networks.
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):** Artificial neural networks specialized for image recognition. Relevance: CNNs are inspired by the hierarchical structure of the visual cortex, but they do not fully capture the complexity of biological vision or implement a generative model.
- **Helmholtz Machine:** A type of generative model that learns both to recognize and generate data. Relevance: This model provides an early example of a system that learns to perceive by simulating, echoing Bennett’s core thesis (Bennett, 2023, p. 177).

### **Key Figures:**

- **Vernon Mountcastle:** A neuroscientist who proposed the neocortical column as a fundamental computational unit. Relevance: Mountcastle's theory suggests a modular and hierarchical organization of the neocortex, which aligns with the generative model hypothesis.
- **Hermann von Helmholtz:** A physicist and physician who proposed the concept of "perception as inference." Relevance: Helmholtz's idea foreshadows the generative model approach, suggesting that perception is an active process of constructing an interpretation of sensory data.
- **Geoffrey Hinton and Peter Dayan:** Researchers who developed the Helmholtz machine. Relevance: Their work demonstrated how a generative model could learn to perceive by simulating.
- **Neal Cohen and Michael McCloskey:** Neuroscientists who studied catastrophic forgetting. Relevance: Their work highlights the challenge of continual learning, a problem that generative models may help solve.
- **Kunihiko Fukushima:** Developed the Neocognitron, an early form of convolutional neural network (Bennett, 2023, p. 136). Relevance: Shows a biologically inspired model for how pattern recognition might work in the human cortex. Fukushima's Neocognitron is more similar to the neocortex of the first mammals which did not yet have the more recent hierarchical structures of later primate visual cortices (Bennett, 2023, p. 138).

### **Central Thesis and Supporting Arguments:**

- **Central Thesis:** The neocortex operates as a generative model, simulating the world to predict and interpret sensory input, enabling sophisticated perception, imagination, and learning.
- **Supporting Arguments:**
    - **Structure of the neocortex:** The layered architecture and columnar organization of the neocortex support the idea of a modular and hierarchical generative model.
    - **Perception as inference:** Illusions, hallucinations, and dreams can be explained as the neocortex generating simulations that sometimes mismatch or are decoupled from sensory input.
    - **Imagination as unconstrained simulation:** Imagination is the neocortex generating simulations without the constraints of sensory input.
    - **Biological plausibility:** Unsupervised learning and the avoidance of catastrophic forgetting in the brain suggest that the neocortex learns in a way that is fundamentally different from current AI systems.
    - **Content addressable memory:** The content addressable memory of the neocortex highlights that, unlike computer memory, biological memories are stored as distributed representations, and thereby allows for such memories to be recalled by activating subsets of this original information (Bennett, 2023, p. 141).

### **Observations and Insights:**

- **The brain's focus on explanation:** The neocortex seeks to find the most likely cause of sensory input, constructing explanations for the world around us.
- **The interplay of prediction and perception:** Perception is not simply a passive process of receiving sensory information, but an active process of predicting and interpreting that information.
- **The blurring of perception and imagination:** The same neural machinery is used for both perceiving the world and imagining alternative possibilities.

### **Unique Interpretations and Unconventional Ideas:**

- **The neocortex as a predictive simulator:** This view contrasts with more traditional views of the neocortex as primarily a sensory processing area.
- **Emphasis on unsupervised learning:** Bennett challenges the dominant paradigm of supervised learning in AI, arguing that the brain learns in a fundamentally different way.

### **Problems and Solutions:**

### **Categorical Items:**

Bennett categorizes different cortical areas (visual, auditory, somatosensory) based on their sensory input, and also discusses layers within the neocortex itself which are organized and interconnected in specific ways that neuroscientists have not been able to fully account for (Bennett, 2023, p. 170-171).

- **Weaknesses:** The chapter necessarily simplifies complex neural processes and theoretical models. The evidence for the generative model hypothesis, while suggestive, is not yet conclusive.

### **Practical Applications:**

- The generative model framework can inspire new approaches to understanding and treating mental disorders like hallucinations and schizophrenia.
- Insights into how the neocortex avoids catastrophic forgetting could inform the development of more effective continual learning algorithms in AI.

### **Connections to Other Chapters:**

- Chapter 7 (Pattern Recognition): This chapter builds upon the discussion of pattern recognition by showing how the cortex uses generative models to solve the problems of discrimination, generalization, and catastrophic forgetting.
- Chapters 8, 9, and 10: These chapters created the evolutionary roadmap for the emergence of the neocortex and its generative capabilities by highlighting how temporal difference learning, curiosity, and model-based planning motivated mammals to develop an internal predictive model of the world, which then evolved into a “simulator” with the neocortex (Bennett, 2023, p. 206).
- Chapter 12 (Mice in Imaginarium): This chapter lays the groundwork for the next step in Bennett’s five breakthrough’s model, by highlighting the limitations of simple pattern recognition and TD learning, which motivates his discussion of how *mammals*, uniquely, evolved new cognitive mechanisms in the neocortex to deal with the challenges associated with an increasing need to plan ahead (Bennett, 2023, p. 188).
- Chapters 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19 and 20: This chapter foreshadows the importance of the neocortex in numerous later chapters, showing how neocortical simulation is essential to how mammals can make more flexible decisions and learn more effectively through *model-based reinforcement learning* (Ch. 13), as well as to how primates, with their large brains driven by *social pressures* (Ch. 16), evolved *theory of mind* mechanisms (Ch. 17) and the capacity to learn by imitating others (Ch. 18). He foreshadows that it is within this same neocortex where humans also developed new areas for language (Ch. 20) and the ability to make plans about the future (Ch. 19)

### **Surprising, Interesting, and Novel Ideas:**

- **The neocortex as a generative model:** This is a relatively new and exciting idea in neuroscience, offering a powerful framework for understanding how the brain creates our experience of the world (Bennett, 2023, p. 176-181).
- **Perception as a "constrained hallucination":** This perspective challenges the traditional view of perception as a passive process, suggesting that our experience of reality is actively constructed by the brain (Bennett, 2023, p. 182).
- **Dreams and imagination as unconstrained simulations:** This interpretation provides a novel explanation for these mental phenomena, linking them to the neocortex's ability to generate experiences without sensory input (Bennett, 2023, p. 182-183).

### **Discussion Questions:**

- How does the concept of a generative model change our understanding of perception, imagination, and consciousness?
- What are the implications of the idea that our experience of reality is a "constrained hallucination"?
- How might the generative model framework be used to develop more sophisticated AI systems?
- What are the limitations of comparing the neocortex to current artificial neural networks?
- How might understanding the neural basis of imagination and dreaming inform our understanding of creativity and problem-solving?

### TL;DR

<aside>
📌

The neocortex, that wrinkled outer layer of the mammalian brain, isn't just for processing sensory input; it's a *simulation machine* (Bennett, 2023, p. 176).  Like advanced AI systems using *generative models*, it learns to predict and interpret the world by generating its own data and comparing it to actual sensory input—a process called "perception as inference" (Bennett, 2023, p. 176).  This explains illusions (the model's predictions mismatching reality), hallucinations (unconstrained simulations when sensory input is cut off, like in Charles Bonnet Syndrome), dreams (the brain exploring possibilities while "offline"), and even imagination (the ultimate unconstrained simulation) (Bennett, 2023, p. 181-183). This "predictive processing" builds on earlier *pattern recognition* (Ch. 7) and *reinforcement learning* (Ch. 6), and its hierarchical, modular structure (neocortical columns), remarkably similar across different brain areas dedicated to vision, hearing, touch and other senses, is more evidence of common algorithms doing diverse jobs (Bennett, 2023, p. 178-179), echoing the core philosophy that intelligence is problem-solving regardless of the ‘problem’ (sensing, moving, etc.) (Bennett, 2023, p. 167).  Key ideas: the neocortex as a generative model, perception as inference, and the link between simulation, imagination, and dreaming.  Unlike simpler model-free *reinforcement learning* (Ch. 6) systems, the simulations of the neocortex pave the way for more sophisticated *model-based learning* (Ch. 13), *planning* (Ch. 12-14), and *mentalizing* (Ch. 16 & 17), as we'll see in primates.
