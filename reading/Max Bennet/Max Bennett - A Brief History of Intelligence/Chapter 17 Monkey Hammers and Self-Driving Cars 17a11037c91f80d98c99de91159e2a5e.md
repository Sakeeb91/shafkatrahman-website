# Chapter 17: Monkey Hammers and Self-Driving Cars

### **Chapter Overview:**

- **Main Focus:** This chapter explores the fascinating intersection of tool use, imitation learning, and the evolution of intelligence, particularly in primates. Bennett argues that the ability to learn by observing and imitating others, combined with sophisticated motor control, is a key driver of primate cognitive abilities and cultural transmission. He uses examples of primate tool use and contrasts these with examples of tool use by other species such as the sea otter or the mongoose or the crow (Bennett, 2023, p. 276) to argue that primate tool use, especially in groups, is qualitatively different. He connects tool use with the earlier breakthrough of theory of mind (Ch. 16), emphasizing how theory of mind was a prerequisite for primates to learn new tools by watching each other (Bennett, 2023, p. 281).
- **Objectives:**
    - Showcase the diversity and sophistication of primate tool use.
    - Explain the role of imitation learning and social learning in acquiring tool-using skills.
    - Connect tool use to the evolution of the motor cortex and the prefrontal cortex.
    - Discuss the challenges of imitation learning in both biological and artificial systems.
    - Highlight the importance of understanding intentions and goals in imitation learning.
- **Fit into Book's Structure:** This chapter represents an important extension of Breakthrough #4, *mentalizing*, by showing how the capacity to model other minds facilitates learning and cultural transmission. It bridges the gap between understanding other minds (Chapter 16) and the unique aspects of human language and cultural evolution (Chapters 19 and 20).

### **Key Terms and Concepts:**

- **Tool Use:** The use of an external object to achieve a goal. Relevance: Tool use is presented as a complex cognitive skill that requires planning, motor control, and often, social learning.
- **Imitation Learning:** Learning by observing and copying the actions of others. Relevance: This is a key mechanism for acquiring tool-using skills and other complex behaviors in primates.
- **Social Learning:** Learning that occurs in a social context, often through observation, imitation, or teaching. Relevance: Social learning is crucial for the transmission of tool use and other cultural practices in primate groups.
- **Mirror Neurons:** Neurons that fire both when an animal performs an action and when it observes another animal performing the same action. Relevance: Mirror neurons are hypothesized to play a role in imitation learning and understanding the intentions of others.
- **Premotor Cortex:** A region of the frontal lobe involved in planning and sequencing movements. Relevance: The premotor cortex is thought to be involved in *simulating* (Ch. 3, 11 & 12) observed actions, which is crucial for imitation learning.
- **Inverse Reinforcement Learning:** A type of machine learning where the algorithm infers the reward function that an expert is optimizing for, based on observing the expert's behavior. Relevance: This approach is discussed in the context of building AI systems that can learn by imitation, showing how AI researchers mimic the theory-of-mind mechanisms present in primate brains when designing self-learning algorithms.
- **"Transmissibility Beats Ingenuity":** The idea that the ability to transmit knowledge and skills through social learning is more important than individual inventiveness. Relevance: This concept highlights the power of culture and its role in the evolution of primate intelligence. Primates may not be individually more intelligent than other animals, but they are more socially intelligent, allowing them to learn more easily from each other (Bennett, 2023, p. 277).

### **Key Figures:**

- **Jane Goodall:** A primatologist known for her groundbreaking research on chimpanzees. Relevance: Goodall's observations of chimpanzee tool use provided early evidence for the complexity of primate tool use and challenged the traditional view of humans as the only tool users (Bennett, 2023, p. 267).
- **Giacomo Rizzolatti:** A neuroscientist who discovered mirror neurons. Relevance: Rizzolatti's work suggests a neural basis for imitation learning and understanding intentions.
- **Dean Pomerleau and Chuck Thorpe:** Researchers who created ALVINN, an early self-driving car. Relevance: ALVINN's success in learning to steer by imitating human drivers highlights the power of imitation learning, even in artificial systems. The system, however, struggled to recover from mistakes. This supports Bennett’s argument that imitating a sequence of behaviors or motor movements is less evolutionarily ‘useful’ than understanding *why* a teacher performed each of those movements, and the *intentions* behind them. Copying everything works only if all the conditions are the same. Whereas understanding *why* and *intent* can help identify when to do certain steps and when not to (Bennett, 2023, p. 279-280).
- **Pieter Abbeel, Adam Coates, and Andrew Ng:** Researchers who developed sophisticated robot control systems for maneuvering helicopters. Relevance: These researchers’ work on inverse reinforcement learning demonstrates a practical approach to building robots that can learn by imitation, rather than being programmed explicitly (Bennett, 2023, p. 279-281). This is contrasted with Pomerleau and Thorpe's more basic approach of simply recording behavior and copying, demonstrating how the study of primate behavior and their use of theory of mind (Ch. 16) has improved AI systems (Bennett, 2023, p. 314-315).
- **Christophe Boesch:** A primatologist known for studying chimpanzee behavior, and who proposed that some chimpanzee mothers may use deliberate “teaching” approaches. Relevance: Boesch’s evidence suggests that chimpanzees understand the limitations in their children’s knowledge and selectively engage in behaviors, like performing motor skills in slow motion and making eye contact with their children to make sure they are paying attention, that suggest an ability to understand the knowledge and attention state of another mind. This is contrasted with examples of other animals, such as mongooses or sea otters who do not teach, and whose children learn solely by watching and practicing (Bennett, 2023, p. 276, 283).

### **Central Thesis and Supporting Arguments:**

- **Central Thesis:** Imitation learning, combined with sophisticated motor control and the ability to understand intentions, plays a crucial role in the acquisition and transmission of tool use and other complex behaviors in primates, driving their cognitive evolution.
- **Supporting Arguments:**
    - **Diversity of primate tool use:** Primates exhibit a wide range of tool-using behaviors, far surpassing other animal species, and use tools for diverse purposes (cleaning their ears, hunting for insects, smashing nuts and beehives) (Bennett, 2023, p. 267-268).
    - **Role of social learning:** Young primates learn tool use primarily through observation and imitation of adults, and this social learning ability is what enables these skills to be passed down across generations (Bennett, 2023, p. 276-277).
    - **Neural mechanisms:** Mirror neurons and the premotor cortex are implicated in imitation learning and understanding intentions. Motor skill expertise in humans is associated with increased activation in the premotor cortex when watching someone perform the *same* motor task they are experts in, but not other tasks, showing a specialized circuit for understanding actions that you yourself have expertise in. And conversely, damage to this same region of premotor cortex in humans and other primates shows impairment in their ability to interpret and understand the *intentions* behind actions they see other people perform (Bennett, 2023, p. 271-273). These seemingly unrelated results point towards the possibility that the role of the premotor cortex is to generate internal models not only of one’s own body movements but of the body movements of *others*. And Bennett suggests that it is this internal model of another’s body movements which enables them to understand the *intent* behind those movements. Bennett supports this with evidence from research showing that humans who struggle to perform a certain motor skill with their own body, like brushing their teeth or using a hammer, also have more difficulty understanding other people’s intentions when watching those other people perform those same motor skills (Bennett, 2023, p. 272).
    - **Challenges of imitation learning in AI:** Building robots that can learn through observation and imitation is a difficult problem, and the solutions often draw inspiration from primate brains.
    - **Importance of understanding intentions:** Effective imitation learning requires understanding the *goals* and *intentions* behind observed actions, not just mimicking movements.

### **Observations and Insights:**

- **The cultural transmission of tool use:** Primate tool use is often culturally specific, with different groups using different techniques, demonstrating how even simple primates have a ‘culture’ not unlike human cultures which is passed down across generations.
- **The interplay between individual learning and social learning:** While primates learn through imitation, they also refine their skills through individual practice and experimentation.
- **The role of theory of mind in tool use acquisition**: Bennett argues that primates are better tool users because they also engage in theory of mind (Ch. 16). He suggests that it is this understanding of another’s mind that enables primates to learn tool-use skills by identifying the difference between what the ‘teacher’ *intended* to do and what the teacher *accidentally* did, and it may also be what enables primates to understand the goals and intentions and the cause-and-effect relationships behind each of the steps required to use a tool successfully, which explains how a chimpanzee can watch another use a tool to get food but skip irrelevant steps (Bennett, 2023, p. 277, 285).
- **The limitations of purely imitative AI**: Bennett uses examples of early self-driving car programs and advanced helicopter control algorithms to demonstrate the need to understand intent not just mimic behavior.

### **Unique Interpretations and Unconventional Ideas:**

- **"Transmissibility beats ingenuity":** This concept highlights the importance of social learning and cultural transmission in the evolution of primate intelligence. This can be seen as an extension of his earlier concept of the ‘hive-brain’ (Ch. 20), emphasizing that primates evolved for “transmissibility” rather than individual “ingenuity” as a mechanism for improving intelligence across generations (Bennett, 2023, p. 282).
- **Emphasis on intent and goal recognition in motor control**: Bennett highlights how theory of mind (Ch. 16) plays a crucial role in motor skill acquisition and cultural transmission (Bennett, 2023, p. 285).

### **Critical Analysis:**

- **Strengths:** The chapter provides a fascinating overview of primate tool use and imitation learning, linking these abilities to broader themes of intelligence and cultural evolution. The inclusion of examples from AI adds a valuable comparative perspective.
- **Weaknesses:** The discussion of mirror neurons could benefit from more nuance, acknowledging the ongoing debate about their precise function. The speculation that theory of mind may have enabled teaching in some primates, though supported by some evidence by Boesch and others, is not universally agreed upon, and the author does not do a sufficient job of explaining this (Bennett, 2023, p. 282).

### **Practical Applications:**

- Understanding the principles of imitation learning can inform the development of more effective teaching methods, training programs, and rehabilitation therapies.
- Insights into how the neocortex creates internal models can inspire new approaches to skill acquisition.

### **Connections to Other Chapters:**

- Chapter 14 (Secret to Dishwashing Robots): This chapter builds on the previous chapter’s discussion of the motor cortex by showing how its predictive and simulative capacity enables the sophisticated motor control required for tool use (Bennett, 2023, p. 241). Specifically, the author links these abilities to the “first-move” advantage of early mammals which then set the stage for increased complexity of simulations to deal with more sophisticated planning and coordination of behavior, paving the way for the emergence of theory of mind and primate social learning. He makes a clear distinction between how early *placental* mammals evolved new parts of the brain, such as the motor cortex, whereas these did not emerge in earlier *marsupial* mammals, highlighting the significance of this brain region in the motor capabilities of modern primates and humans (Bennett, 2023, p. 206).
- Chapter 16 (How to Model Other Minds): This chapter builds upon the previous chapter’s discussion of theory of mind by showing how primates’ capacity for theory of mind improves *social learning*. The author argues that this ability to understand and infer the *intent* and goals of another is what allows primates to filter noisy and irrelevant data in what they observe and pass down only the essential aspects of a tool using skill, allowing the more accurate and efficient transmission of behaviors from generation to generation and avoiding the problem where individually invented skills that are too complex get ‘diluted’ over time as they are passed down without understanding the intent behind each step (Bennett, 2023, p. 276-277, 282-284). This links tool use, imitation learning and theory of mind together, setting up the next chapter’s discussion of why such capabilities were advantageous for the evolution of primate intelligence and why, despite the fact that all three abilities are somewhat costly (greater brain complexity and thus caloric needs), these may have evolved to improve the “political savvy” of primates.
- Chapters 19 and 20 (Human Uniqueness and Language): This chapter foreshadows the unique role of tool use and imitation learning in human evolution and the development of cumulative culture, setting up the final chapter’s discussion of how the human hive-mind emerged. It also highlights the limitations of current AI systems in replicating these uniquely primate (and human) capabilities.

### **Surprising, Interesting, and Novel Ideas:**

- **The diversity and sophistication of primate tool use:** Bennett highlights how primates use tools for a wide range of purposes, challenging the traditional view of tool use as a uniquely human trait (Bennett, 2023, p. 267-268).
- **"Transmissibility beats ingenuity":** This concept emphasizes the importance of social learning and cultural transmission in the evolution of primate intelligence (Bennett, 2023, p. 277).
- **The use of inverse reinforcement learning in AI:** This approach, inspired by theory of mind, offers a promising avenue for building robots that can learn by imitation (Bennett, 2023, p. 279-281).

## TL;DR:

<aside>
📌

Primates are master imitators, and tool use is their jam.  Unlike other tool-using animals (like crows or sea otters) who stick to one trick, primates show remarkable flexibility and *transmissibility* of skills (Bennett, 2023, p. 267-268, 275). This isn't just about clever hands (*motor cortex*, Ch. 14); it's about understanding *intent*.  Mirror neurons in the premotor cortex help *simulate* (Ch. 3, 11, & 12) observed actions, and *theory of mind* (Ch. 16) allows primates to grasp the *goals* behind those actions (Bennett, 2023, p. 268-273, 276).  Just as AI researchers use "inverse *reinforcement* learning" (Ch. 6 & 13) to build robots that infer human intentions (like self-driving cars learning from expert drivers), young chimps learn by watching their mothers, skipping unnecessary steps because they get the underlying *goal* (Bennett, 2023, p. 276-281, 283-284).  Key ideas: tool use as a marker of social learning, transmissibility over ingenuity, mirror neurons, and the link between intent and imitation. Core philosophy: Intelligence is about learning from others, not just individual discovery, paving the way for cumulative culture (setting up Ch. 19 & 20). This chapter bridges *mentalizing* (Ch. 4 & 16) and tool use, highlighting a key advantage in primate intelligence and demonstrating that social learning, combined with sophisticated *motor control*, is what sets them up to dominate.
